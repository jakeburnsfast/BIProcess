## Service Offered
Design and implement business intelligence architecture from source data extraction through report adoption.

## Guiding Principles
* Simple
* Durable
* Transferable

## Pricing
* Fixed price based on:
  * Number / nature of source systems
  * Landscape of desired reporting
  * Complexity of transforms

## Process
* Design (metrics needed, source systems, cloude infrastructure)
* Extract (attach pipeline to source data)
* Load (deposit source data in data lake in SQL friendly format) - common, efficient language
* Transform (build star schema data models to support needed KPIs) (single fact if possible, for simplicity & transferability)
* Validate (confirm the intelligence is accurate)
* Stabilize (ensure data lake matches source and all procedures run successfully)
* Present (deliver KPIs through reporting interface)


### Design
>* Client meeting to review A. current KPIs and B. desired KPIs
>* Undestand in-house capabilities and capacity
>* Review of source systems needed to drive each
>* Alignment with client on what constitutes a reasonable Phase 1
>* 20-40 hour detailed scoping effort and execution plan **OFFERING A w/ DETAILS**

### Implementation
>* Standup cloud infrastructure / permissionings / licensing
>* Initial extract/load of source data to data lake
>* Stabilize daily extract/load process with delta logic as needed

># Why Microsoft
* Full toolset (extraction, staging, modeling, reporting)
* Recent integrations with many data sources / non native languages
* Azure (cloud environment) has reasonable costs
