# BI Service: Full Implementation
### Cloud business intelligence architecture from source data extraction through report adoption.
#### Simple | Durable | Transferable
<br>

## Pricing
#### Fixed price based on:
* Number / nature of source systems
* Landscape of desired reporting
* Complexity of transforms

## Process
#### Seven phases of development:
* Design (metrics needed, source systems, cloude infrastructure)
* Extract (attach pipeline to source data)
* Load (deposit source data in data lake in SQL friendly format) - common, efficient language
* Transform (build star schema data models to support needed KPIs) (single fact if possible, for simplicity & transferability)
* Validate (confirm the intelligence is accurate)
* Stabilize (ensure data lake matches source and all procedures run successfully)
* Present (deliver KPIs through reporting interface)

## Platform
#### Microsoft Azure family of cloud resources:
* Full toolset (extraction, staging, modeling, reporting)
* Recent integrations with many data sources / non native languages
* Reasonable / flexible costs 
<br> 


## Development Phases
### 1. Design
>* Meet with client to review current **and** desired KPIs
>* Understand in-house technical abilities and capacity to support the project
>* Review of source systems needed to drive the KPIs identified
>* Align with client on what constitutes a reasonable Phase 1
>* 20-40 hours to develope detailed roadmap and pricing **$4,000 up-front cost**
>* Meet with client to review roadmap.  Determine if the project will move forward

### Implementation
>* Standup cloud infrastructure / permissionings / licensing
>* Initial extract/load of source data to data lake
>* Stabilize daily extract/load process with delta logic as needed
