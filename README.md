# Service: Full BI Implementation
### Cloud business intelligence solution from source data extraction through report adoption
#### Simple | Durable | Transferable
<br>

## Pricing
#### Fixed price based on:
* Number / nature of source systems
* Landscape of desired reporting
* Complexity of transforms

## Process
#### Seven phases of development:
* Design (metrics needed, source systems, cloude infrastructure)
* Extract (attach pipeline to source data)
* Load (deposit source data in data lake in SQL friendly format) - common, efficient language
* Transform (build star schema data models to support needed KPIs) (single fact if possible, for simplicity & transferability)
* Validate (confirm the intelligence is accurate)
* Stabilize (ensure data lake matches source and all procedures run successfully)
* Present (deliver KPIs through reporting interface)

## Platform
#### Microsoft Azure family of cloud resources:
* Full toolset (extraction, staging, modeling, reporting)
* Recent integrations with many data sources / non native languages
* Reasonable / flexible costs

## Development Phases
### 1. Design
>* Meet with client to review current **and** desired KPIs
>* Understand in-house technical abilities and capacity to support the project
>* Review of source systems needed to drive the KPIs identified
>* Align with client on what constitutes a reasonable Phase 1
>* 20-40 hours to develope detailed roadmap and pricing **$4,000 up-front cost**
>* Meet with client to review roadmap.  Determine if the project will move forward
>* Simple (text and diagrams), Durable (should keep relevance for ~2 years), Transferrable (well-documented)

### 2. Extract
>* Obtain stable access to client source data
>* Author applications / flow required to extract data into the pipeline(s)
>* Author any processes required to reformat data into common format (CSV/JSON/SQL)
>* Simple (control tables, low code pipelines), Durable (use popular Azure tools), Transferable (best practice used and well-documented)

### 3. Load
>* Load extracted data into cloud data lake
>* Identify the newly staged data necessary to drive reporting
>* Implement best storage / format / query language design for the reporting data
>* Ensure that all reporting data can be accessed / transformed through SQL
>* Simple (...

### 4. Transform
>* Review star schema data models presented in the roadmapping phase
>* Transform staged data into required dimension sql objects
>* Transform staged data in required fact sql objects
>* Write in any additional business logic needed for reporting
>* Simple (...
